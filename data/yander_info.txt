Yander.io - Remote Team Management SaaS

WHAT IT DOES:
Yander is a Software as a Service (SaaS) that integrates with Slack, Gmail, Notion, Zoom, and meeting recording software to track behavioral changes and actions taken by employees. It provides leaders and managers with insights to make proactive decisions.

KEY METRICS TRACKED:
- Sentiment analysis
- Workload monitoring
- Engagement levels
- Collaboration patterns
- Meeting attendance and quality

CORE USE CASES:
1. Fix workload issues to prevent burnout
2. Assign more work to employees who are not at capacity
3. Notice when a team member is checked out and step in before clients are affected
4. Prevent A players from resigning/quitting the company
5. Ensure that critical meetings are actually happening

TARGET MARKET:
Remote teams where leaders lack visibility into:
- What work employees are actually doing
- Employee sentiment and morale
- Employee workload distribution
- Early warning signs of problems

Problems usually only surface when it's too late (resignations or client dissatisfaction).

UNIQUE POSITIONING - NON-SURVEILLANCE:
We are strictly non-surveillance, meaning:
❌ NO time trackers
❌ NO screen recording
❌ NO access to private Slack channels
❌ NO access to private email threads

✅ Only access areas leaders already have access to:
- Slack channels they're in
- Email threads they're on
- Meetings they're invited to
- Team meetings (with open company consent for recording)

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:
- Recognition for great work
- Early intervention when drowning in work
- Better work-life balance
- Job security through proactive issue resolution
- Happier, more sustainable work environment

LEADERSHIP BENEFITS:
- Prevent burnout before it happens
- Optimize workload distribution
- Retain top performers
- Protect client relationships
- Data-driven team management
- Early warning system for team issues

DIFFERENTIATORS:
- Non-surveillance approach (privacy-first)
- Multi-platform integration (Slack, Gmail, Notion, Zoom, etc.)
- Behavioral change detection (not just metrics)
- Proactive alerts (not just dashboards)
- Win-win for leaders AND employees
