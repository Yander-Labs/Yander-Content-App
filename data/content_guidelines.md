# Content Creation Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all posts, scripts, and content created by the content creation agents.

## Core Principles

### 1. Protect Client Relationships
- **Never bash or criticize clients** - even anonymously or in general terms
- Frame client-related stories around your own learnings, not client shortcomings
- If discussing challenges, focus on strategic decisions you made, not client behavior
- Remember: clients and prospects see your content

### 2. Protect Team Relationships
- **Never openly discuss hiring mistakes** or frame team members negatively
- Focus on your growth as a leader, not team member failures
- Share learnings about building better systems and processes
- Remember: current and future team members see your content

### 3. Lead with Positivity and Authority
- Tell stories that showcase growth and transformation
- Admit your own mistakes freely - that's authentic leadership
- Frame challenges as opportunities for learning
- End with actionable insights, not complaints

## Content Framing Guidelines

### When Discussing Client Situations

**Instead of:**
> "This client was demanding and exhausted my team"

**Write:**
> "We realized we had become too dependent on one relationship and made a strategic decision to diversify"

**Instead of:**
> "The client changed scope constantly"

**Write:**
> "We learned the importance of clear scope agreements and communication"

### When Discussing Team/Hiring Situations

**Instead of:**
> "My first hire was a disaster and quit after 6 weeks"

**Write:**
> "Early on, I learned that hiring talent is only half the equation - setting them up for success is the real challenge"

**Instead of:**
> "They told me I was a bad manager"

**Write:**
> "I received feedback that helped me become a better leader"

## Story Structure That Works

1. **Hook** - Call out a relatable pain point or challenge
2. **Situation** - Briefly set the scene (keep it about YOUR journey)
3. **Realization** - The insight or turning point
4. **Action** - What you changed or built
5. **Result** - The positive outcome
6. **Lesson** - Universal takeaway for the reader
7. **Engagement** - Question to spark conversation

## What TO Share
- Your own mistakes and growth as a founder/leader
- Strategic decisions and the thinking behind them
- Systems and processes you've built
- Lessons learned from your journey
- Industry insights and trends
- Wins and milestones (celebrated humbly)

## What NOT TO Share
- Specific client complaints or criticisms
- Team member failures or negative performance stories
- Confidential business information
- Anything that could embarrass a client, partner, or team member
- Rants or venting (even if "relatable")

## Quick Checklist Before Publishing

- [ ] Would I be comfortable if my biggest client read this?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable if my team read this?
- [ ] Does this make me look like a leader worth following?
- [ ] Is the story focused on MY growth, not others' failures?
- [ ] Does this provide genuine value to the reader?
- [ ] Does it end on a constructive, forward-looking note?
