COMPANY VALUES:
1. We trust you to own it
   - Ownership mindset is the baseline expectation
   - Don't wait for permission to do great work
   - See a problem? Fix it. See an opportunity? Take it.
   - Autonomy is earned through reliability

2. Under-promise and over-deliver early
   - Timing matters as much as quality
   - Early delivery creates breathing room and signals competence
   - Pad timelines internally, not externally
   - Build in QA time before delivery, not after

3. When they win, we win
   - Be an extension of your client's team, not just a vendor
   - Client success is our success - not a talking point, a business model
   - Care about outcomes, not just outputs
   - Go beyond scope when it matters
